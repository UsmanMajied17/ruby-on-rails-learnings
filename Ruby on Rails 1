Hello Rails I
Ruby on Rails is a web framework that makes it easy to build powerful web apps in a short amount of time.

Ruby on Rails is written in the Ruby programming language. If you are new to Ruby, we recommend you first take our Ruby course.

Instructions
1.
Let’s get started by making a Rails app for a personal website. We’ll explain each step in the next exercise.

In the terminal, type

$ rails new MySite 
2.
Then run

$ bundle install 
3.
Finally type

$ rails server 
Then, view the Rails app in the browser by visiting http://localhost:8000 in the provided browser.

Then click Next to find out what these commands do.

BACKGROUND
When developing a Rails app, the request/response cycle is a useful guide to see how all the app’s files and folders fit together. The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren’t working).

HOW IT WORKS
Request/response cycle

A user opens his browser, types in a URL, and presses Enter.
When a user presses Enter, the browser makes a request for that URL.
The request hits the Rails router (config/routes.rb). The router maps the URL to the correct controller and action to handle the request.
The action receives the request and passes it on to the view.
The view renders the page as HTML.
The controller sends the HTML back to the browser. The page loads and the user sees it.
In this way, the request/response cycle is a useful way to see how a Rails app’s files and folders are for and how they fit together.
